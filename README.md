# Template Engine - Employee summary

This app allows users to easily keep track of their teammate's information using a CLI. 
For this assingment we were provied the files inside of the templates folder and the test folder. 

I created a main Employee class and extended from it a Manager, Intern, and Engineer class. 
These classes were used as cookie cutters for the objects created by the inquirer prompts. 

When the user has answered all questions about their employee, they have the option to add another teammate. 
If they want to stop adding more teammates, they can answer "n" to the prompt, which causes their html file to be written.
